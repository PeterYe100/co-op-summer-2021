My favorite editor is Visual Studio Code. 

Reason 1 - Can utilize different terminals simultaneously

Foremost, Visual Studio Code is versatile because it has built-in terminals to replicate different virtual environments. 
For instance, it can simulate a Linux-based terminal such as a windows subsystem for Linux to execute commands regardless 
of a computer's operating system. Moreover, it can also access the default terminal for an operating system such as the 
command line for Windows. Furthermore, it is capable of both displaying and running coroutines with multiple terminals simultaneously. 
Lastly, it could also create different terminal instances through its user interface without running and executing commands and scripts, respectively.

Reason 2 - Capable of supporting multiple programming languages

Visual Studio Code is also flexible in handling different programming languages. For instance, it supports editing 
functionality for Python, C++, C, C#, HTML/CSS, and many other languages. Furthermore, it displays source code with 
color-coding text for programming language-specific syntax. Moreover, it also utilizes auto-completion commands for 
boilerplates to accelerate the process of coding. Lastly, it can also predict syntax for variables, methods, and functions. 

Reason 3 - Possesses built-in debugging breakpoints and text comparison features/ version control features

Moreover, Visual Studio Code has multipurpose functions such as possessing built-in debugging breakpoints and version 
control features. The built-in debugging breakpoints assist in identifying various errors such as syntax errors, 
compilation errors, and run-time errors. Visual Studio displays these debugging breakpoints in a source code file and a terminal. 
Furthermore, Visual Studio Code's version control features are capable of understanding file changes following git updates. 
It also provides a UI to accept incoming and existing file changes.
